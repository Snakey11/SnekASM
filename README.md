## A dump of tools and assembly hacks for FE8 by Snek

All download links for my things should point here. It should be pretty straightforward how to get to where you want to go.
If you run into any issues or have suggestions, feel free to contact me on Discord via DM (Snakey1#4148) or by DM on feuniverse.us (Snakey1). I don't bite!
For installation instructions, please refer to [my FEU ASM thread](https://feuniverse.us/t/snakes-pit-of-asm-and-other-stuff/3627).
